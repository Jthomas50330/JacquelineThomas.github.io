    <h3>Niagara Falls</h3>
    <p>Niagara Falls is located in both New York and Canada. I had always wanted to go there ever since I saw them in the "Superman" movie. </p>

          <h4>A Barrel of Fun</h4>
          <p>As you can see, my aunt and I had a wonderful time. It was a hot day, so we decided to cool off going over the falls. My sister dared us to do it!</p>

          <h4>We Survived!</h4>
          <p> We survived to tell a story, and I survived to do some coding about it.</p>

          <h4>A Story it Was!</h4>
          <p> Just kidding! This was a souvenir pic. It was nice to feel the mist on a humid day in New York.</p>

          <h4>Maid of the Mist</h4>
          <p>My favorite part of the falls was riding on the Maid of the Mist. We got to see Falls close up. It was an awesome experience!</p>

          <h4>Canada</h4>
          <p>I recommend staying on the Canadian side if you like to do the touristy stuff. They have lots of restaurants and shops.</p>

      <h2>Other Places I have Visited</h2>
      <h2>Alaska</h2>
      <p>Last summer, I took a cruise to Alaska. I loved seeing the Mendenhall Glacier, the Hubbard Glacier, and all the wildlife. I even got to go Ziplining!

      <h2>China</h2>
      <p>I conquered my fear of flying so that I could travel to China. I visited Beijing, Xi'an, and Shanghai. One of my favorite experiences was visiting the tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang and his Terrcotta Warriors.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Yosemite</h2>
      <p>One can always find peace and tranquility in Yosemite National Park. The scenery is breathtaking, and there is plenty to do. I would love to hike Half Dome someday.</p>

      <h2>Bucket List</h2>
      <p> I would like to travel to Hawaii, Germany, and Holland in the near future. I have even thought about doing a volunteer vacation in Indonesia.</p>
